## Face Recognition using live feed in webcam

Through this project we:-

•	Implemented face recognition through webcam using Cascade classifier, OpenCV and Convolutional Neural Network

•	Captured faces focusing on feature detection, modeling using Deep Learning CNN, TensorFlow & achieved accuracy of 95% 

In simple words, the webcam will capture the image of person in front of it.Then it will detect the name of the person if it has been trained for it.
